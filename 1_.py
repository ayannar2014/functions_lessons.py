#Function = a block of reusable code place () after the func. to invoke it 

# def happy_birthday(name, age): 
#     print(f"Happy birthday to {name}")
#     print(f"You are {age} years old")
#     print("Happy birthday to you!")
#     print()

# happy_birthday("Ayanna", 17)

#     print(f"Your bill of {amount} is due {due_date}")

# display_invoice ("Ayanna", 42.50, "01/01") 

#return is statement to end function and send result back to caller 

# def add (x, y): 
#     z = x+y 
#     return z

#     z = x-y 
#     return z 

# def multiply (x,y):
#     z = x * y 
#     return z 

# def divide (x,y):
#     z = x / y 
#     return z 

# print (add(1,5))

# Add the element "orange" as the fourth element of the following list fruits, using the insert() method:

# fruits = ["mango", "banana", "cherry", "plum", "grapefruit"]

# Search the documentation for the requested method to know how it works.

# Methods, Help & Documentation Practice #3
# Check if the sets below are isolated (that is, they have no elements in common), using the isdisjoint() method. Store this result in the isolated_sets variable:

# phone_brands = {"Samsung", "Xiaomi", "Apple", "Huawei", "LG"}
# tv_brands = {"Sony", "Philips", "Samsung", "LG"}
# Search the documentation for the requested method to know how it works.
